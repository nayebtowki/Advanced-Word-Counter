<h2>#Advanced-Word-Counter</h2>
<p><b>The main objective of this exercise is to produce a Java program in Eclipse that is capable of counting the unique words in a
  text file and displaying them (the word and the frequency of the word) in a GUI application (not using Window Builder). 
  This task is an individual project.</p></b>

<h3>This task is an individual project:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The GUI application (Advanced Word Counter) must have a Text Area to display the results 
  (the frequency of the word and the word) and one button to start counting and displaying the words and their frequencies.</li>
<li> The GUI application must be able to open the text file and display its contents in the console.</li>
<li>The GUI application needs to be able to count the unique words in the opened text file and display the results in the Text Area using the following format 
  (frequency of the word, the word) in a descending order.</li>
<li>For example, sample result in the Text Area will look like:</br>
    &emsp;(467, java)</br>
    &emsp;(390, gui)</br>
    &emsp;(260, import)</br>
    &emsp;(199, class)</li></ul>

<h4>Features required in the Word Counter program include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Counting and displaying the number of words in the original file.</li>
<li>Removing the punctuations from the original file before counting the unique words. A full list of the punctuations is provided in the Appendix B.</li>
<li> Converting all words to lower case before counting the unique words.</li>
<li>Removing the English stop words before displaying the final results. A full list of English stop words is provided in Appendix B.</li>
<li>Displaying the unique words and their frequencies in a descending order in the Text Area as shown in the example above.</li>
</ul></p>
